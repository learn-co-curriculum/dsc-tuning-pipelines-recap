# Pipelines - Recap

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:
* Machine Learning Pipelines create a nice workflow to combine data manipulations, preprocessing, and modeling
* Machine Learning Pipelines can be used along with grid search to evaluate several parameter settings 
* Grid search can considerably blow up computation time when computing for several parameters along with cross-validation
* Some models are very sensitive to hyperparameter changes, so they should be chosen with care, and even with big grids a good outcome isn't always guaranteed
