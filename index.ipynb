    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "* Machine Learning Pipelines create a nice workflow to combine data manipulations, preprocessing, and modeling\n",
    "* Machine Learning Pipelines can be used along with grid search to evaluate several parameter settings \n",
    "* Grid search can considerably blow up computation time when computing for several parameters along with cross-validation\n",
    "* Some models are very sensitive to hyperparameter changes, so they should be chosen with care, and even with big grids a good outcome isn't always guaranteed"
